Mindcare: Your Free Mental Wellness Companion
Mindcare is a free, open-source web platform dedicated to promoting foundational mental health awareness, offering self-help resources, and connecting users with basic informational support. Our mission is to make simple, reliable mental wellness tools accessible to everyone, regardless of financial constraint.

‚ú® Core Features (V1.0)
Mindcare is built on a static architecture (no server or database) to ensure long-term, free accessibility.

Tools & Techniques (services.html): Simple, instant self-help exercises like Guided Breathing and Grounding techniques that work purely on the client side.

Resource Library (resources.html): A curated index of static articles and informational guides on managing common challenges.

Blog (blog.html): Updates and deeper dives into wellness topics, utilizing dedicated static HTML files (blog-posts/).

Crisis & Support (contact.html): Clear, immediate access to professional crisis hotlines, explicitly positioned ahead of general contact information.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer
Mindcare is an informational resource only and is not a substitute for professional mental health diagnosis, treatment, or therapy. If you are in crisis, please use the professional hotlines listed on our Contact page immediately.
