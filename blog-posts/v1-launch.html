            <h2>Why We Built Mindcare</h2>
            <p>
                In a world where professional mental health care can be expensive and hard to find, we saw a critical need for an easily reachable source of reliable, basic self-help information. Mindcare was created by a small, volunteer team, leveraging **free and open-source tools** to keep our promise: **no cost, no barriers.** We are not selling subscriptions or charging for access—just offering genuine support.
            </p>

            <h2>What You'll Find in V1.0</h2>
            <p>
                This initial version of Mindcare focuses on providing immediate, actionable value. Here are the core features you can start using today:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Resource Library:</strong> A growing collection of articles and guides on common challenges like stress, anxiety, and sleep hygiene.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tools & Techniques:</strong> Simple, guided exercises, including our popular **Box Breathing** and **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding** methods, available instantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crisis Mapping:</strong> A clearly visible and vital section on our Contact page with links and numbers for professional, immediate help—because your safety is our top priority.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Free Hosting Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                You may notice Mindcare runs very quickly and simply. This is intentional! By relying on **free hosting and static architecture**, we ensure the project is sustainable without relying on complex, expensive servers or generating ad revenue. This commitment to efficiency means our focus remains entirely on **you** and the quality of the information we provide.
            </p>

            <h2>What’s Next? (The Roadmap)</h2>
            <p>
                Mindcare is always growing. Here's a quick look at what we hope to bring to the platform next, powered entirely by volunteer time and community contributions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Expansion of the Resource Library:** More in-depth articles on topics like motivation and habit building.</li>
                <li>**A Simple Journaling Feature:** A text-based tool (likely local to the user's browser) for private reflection.</li>
                <li>**Community Feedback Integration:** Making it easier for you to request the content you need most.</li>
            </ul>
